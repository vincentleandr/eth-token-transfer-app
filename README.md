# About
This app was built as a part of my learning journey and to satisfy my interest in learning Blockchain and Web3.

It was built using these tech stacks:
- React
- Typescript
- Next.js
- Ether.js -> for interacting with Web3 (Ethereum chain)
- Solidity -> for the smart contract
- SCSS -> for styling

Before any development, I also [designed the UI](https://www.figma.com/file/Vg5s9I4A8IoLYYGVECfriG/ETH-Token-Transfer-App?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=rByReZlEy2g3RKRI-1) using Figma.

# Features
This app is a pretty simple Web3 app that covers the basic and functionalities like:
- Connect / disconnect Web3 wallet
- Detect changes on wallet (account or network)
- Transfer token e.g. ETH and ERC-20 token
- Whitelist address
- Mint ERC-20 token
- Integrated to a [smart contract](https://github.com/vincentleandr/vince-token-contract) (Solidity) of an ERC-20 token that I've created

# Demo
Feel free to play around with the app here https://eth-token-transfer-app.vercel.app.
